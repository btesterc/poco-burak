Which number is bigger? ca. 15 min
Declare 2 variables, both numbers. Compare which number is greater Log the output, e.g. "The greater number
of 5 and 10 is 10." Add an output for the else statement, e.g. "The smaller number of 5 and 10 is 5."


solution: 

calculate function (num1, num2) :
    if num1 > num2 
            print ( you gave us num1 and num2 num1 bigger than num2 )
        ELSE   
            print ( you gave us num1 and num2 num2 bigger than num1 )
