take the number or and the list or create 
be sure that list in order or sorted.

create a function  it needs a list and number to find)
    find the length of the list
    set begin = 0
    set end = length
    set mid = 0

    create a loop and check
    first calculate the mid = (end + begin)/2
 
    if number < list[mid] ignore the right half
        end = mid - 1
    
    elif number > list[mid] ignore the left side
        begin = mid + 1
 
    elif number = list[mid] 
        return mid
        # means number is present at mid
        
 
    # If we reach here, then the element was not present
 return -1
 
call function and check the solution
 
 result = function (......)
if result != -1:
    print("Element is present at index", str(result))
else:
    print("Element is not present in array")
