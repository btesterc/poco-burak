Write a program that asks the user for a date. Find the day of the year for the given date. For example,
January 1st would be 1, and December 31st is 365.
a) Do not include leap years.
b) Include leap years. Check the rules for leap years on the internet, and implement them in your program.


solution: 

month = [ 31, 28, ....   ]

let monthNumber = input (which month ? 1-12)
let day = input (which day today ?)
let year = input (which year ?)
let totalDay = 0
if (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0) {
    month[1] = 29
}
for i=0; i< montNUmber-1; i++ ;
    currentmonthday = month[i]
    totalDay = currentmonthday + totalDay

return console.log ( "today is the {totalDay + day} day of the year")
